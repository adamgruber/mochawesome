## Pull requests

**Contributions are welcome**! Pull requests will be reviewed and may be integrated into the codebase at my discretion.

## Triaging and Closing Issues

I will make every effort to triage each issue in a timely manner. If you open an issue it is expected that you will respond to any questions and/or provide additional feedback when requested. In an effort to keep the issues manageable, any issues awaiting further feedback that are more than 30 days old may be closed.
