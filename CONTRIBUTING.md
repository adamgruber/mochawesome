## Submitting Issues

### Example required

**All bug reports and problem issues require example code**. The best way to do this and ensure the issue can be debugged in the same environment in which it is occurring is to link to a repo where the issue can be reliably reproduced. In addition please submit the following:

- Platform you are running on
- The version of mochawesome and mocha you are using
- How you are calling mocha (via CLI, gulp, or some other means)

Providing a sample test is the best way to get your issue addressed and without it your issue may be closed.  
You must provide a clear and simple way to reproduce the issue.

## Pull requests

**Contributions are welcome**! Pull requests will be reviewed and may be integrated into the codebase at my discretion.

## Triaging and Closing Issues

I will make every effort to triage each issue in a timely manner. If you open an issue it is expected that you will respond to any questions and/or provide additional feedback when requested. In an effort to keep the issues manageable, any issues awaiting further feedback that are more than 30 days old may be closed.
